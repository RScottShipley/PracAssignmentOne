This file is an overview and analysis of the coupons.crv.
Findings: 
  For the coupons for the bars:
    It was found that a majority of the people that had actually used the coupons that they were given were above the age of 21,
    did not have children in their car, and either had an unmarried partner or spouse.
  Future steps and approach:
    Only offer the bar coupons to drivers over the age of 21, preferably in some relationship, and without their children.
  
  For the coupons for the restaurants less than $20:
    Here we found interesting data pointing towards lower income classes, unemployment and interesting data points pertaining to health care
    employees. The analysis shows that people who are between $0-$65,000 have around a 70% chance of using the coupon given to them for 
    restaurants less than $20. This statistic drops around 10% for the range $65,000-$100,000 and goes back up to 70% for those above $100,000.
    When looked at from an occupational and destination standpoint, we found that there was a huge number of unemployed drivers using the coupons.
    Upon further analysis however, there was a higher likely hood, and a much more stable statistic surrounding health care employees, sitting
    around 75% no matter the destination.
  Future steps and approach:
    The coupons would be well targeted to hospital employees and those that are unemployed. Also, from many occupations, it is safer to give
    a driver heading to work a coupon than a driver heading home.
